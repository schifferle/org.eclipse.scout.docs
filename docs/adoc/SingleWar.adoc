== Deploy a Scout Application as a single .war file

It is possible to run and deploy a scout application within a single JVM.
Instead of invoking services annotated with `@TunnelToServer` using the scout service tunnel, they should be called directly.
This can be achieved by including `org.eclipse.scout.rt.serverbridge` in your dependencies.

    <artifactId>org.eclipse.scout.rt.serverbridge</artifactId>
</dependency>
