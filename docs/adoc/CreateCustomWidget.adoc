== Create Custom Widget

This is a very rough guide how to create your custom widget/field.
For details please refer to https://github.com/bsi-software/org.eclipse.scout.docs under
/code/heatmap you find the example of a heat map implemented as custom scout field using the java script libraries from http://leafletjs.com and
https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.heat.

=== Step by step scaffolding
* As a host for your new widget either create a new scout project with {yourWidgtetName}.demo as artifact id or use an existing scout project.
* Create a new maven project {yourWidgetName}.client
** add dependency to org.eclipse.scout.rt.client
* Create a new maven projet {yourWidgetName}.ui.html
** add dependency to org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html
** add dependency {yourWidgetName}.client
* Create a AbstractFormField implementation in the new client project with an interface that extends IFormField.
* crate src/main/js as source folder
* Create {YourFieldName}.js in {yourWidgetName}.ui.html\src/main/js/{yourWidgetName}
** scout.{YourFieldName} inherits from scout.FormField
** implement at least _render($parent)
* Create {YourFieldName}.css in {yourWidgetName}.ui.html\src/main/js/{yourWidgetName}
* Create {yourWidgetName}-module.js in {yourWidgetName}.ui.html\src/main/js
* Create {yourWidgetName}-module.css in {yourWidgetName}.ui.html\src/main/js
* Create {yourWidgetName}.ui.html\src\main\resources\META-INF\scout.xml
* Still in {yourWidgetName}.ui.html create classes:
** Json{YourFieldName}
** JsonObjectFactory
* {yourWidgetName}.demo.client gets a dependency to {yourWidgetName}.client
* {yourWidgetName}.demo.ui.html.app.dev gets a dependency to {yourWidgetName}.ui.html
* in index.html: make sure res/all-macro.css and res/all-macro.js are used (instead of scout-module.css/js directly)
* edit all-macro.css and all-macro.js to include scout-module.css/js and {yourWidgetName}-module.js/css

=== Properties and Events
* Properties: See JsonHeatmapField.initJsonProperties(IHeatmapField model) for how to init properties that are automatically managed by the JsonAdapter,
which means they're automatically included in the object returned by the toJson() method and also are propagated to the browser-side client
when a property change event occurs.
* Events: See IHeatmapListener and it's implementation for how to propagate events from the client model to the html-ui

=== Layouting
See HeatmapFieldLayout.js and it's usage in HeatmapField._render() for an example how to hook in scout's layout mechanism.

=== Testing with Selenium
