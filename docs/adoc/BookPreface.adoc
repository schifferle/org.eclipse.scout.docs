== Preface

The goal of this book is to get you familiar with the Scout framework in a short time.
Scout's core features and concepts are introduced and explained by writing actual Scout applications.
As Scout applications are written in Java, we make the assumption that you are familiar with the Java language and its core concepts.

We hope that this book helps you to get started quickly and would love to get your feedback.
This feedback is very valuable to us as it helps to improve both the book's content and the quality for all future readers.
