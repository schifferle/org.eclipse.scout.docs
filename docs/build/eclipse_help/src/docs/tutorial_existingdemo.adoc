With this tutorial you will learn how to import the Scout Demo Application into your workspace.
The tutorial consists of the following two parts:

* Install the Scout Demo application
* Run the Scout demo from your IDE

==== Install the Scout Demo Application

In the first part of the tutorial we import the demo applications using the https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_Installer[Oomph Eclipse installer] tool.

In the Eclipse IDE open the [wizard]_Import_ wizard with menu menu:File[Import...].
This opens the dialog shown in <<img-oomph_existing_project>>.
Next, under folder [folder]_Oomph_ select the node [folder]_Projects into Workspace_ and click the btn:[Next] button.

The [wizard]_Eclipse Importer_ contains the folder hierarchy [folder]_Eclipse Projects_, [folder]_Scout_ and [folder]_Scout Demo App_ as shown in <<img-oomph_exiting_projects1>>.
You can enter "Scout Demo" in the search filter to find the project easily.

Now, add the desired project to the list to import according to the following steps.

* [1] Select the "Scout Demo App" element.
* [2] Add it to the list of projects using the btn:["Add Projects"] (down arrow) button.
* [3] Adjust the Stream to the milestone build matching your Eclipse IDE, eg. "`Neon (M4 release)`" for January 2016.

Once the project selection in your Eclipse importer looks as shown in <<img-oomph_exiting_projects2>> Click on the btn:[Next] button.

On the [wizard]_Variables_ dialog of the Eclipse importer a number of Oomph variables have to be specified.
In case you have already used Oomph for other purposes, this step might look different or empty (for example when all variables have been set in a previous Oomph session).

Make sure to display all variables by activating checkbox `Show all Variables` in the bottom left corner as shown in <<img-oomph_exiting_variables>>.

WARNING: The variables in <<img-oomph_exiting_variables>> may be shown in a different order in your case.

Before you proceed make sure that all shown variables are set appropriately for your use case.
For the settings proposed below we assume that we only need read access for the git repository hosting the Scout demo application.

* `Git clone location rule`: "`Located in a folder named '.git/{lt}repo{gt}' within the workspace folder`"
* `Target Platform`: "`None`"
* `JRE 1.7 Location`: Path to your Java 7 JRE
* `JRE 1.8 Location`: Path to your Java 8 JRE
* `Scout Demo App Github repository`: "`HTTPS (read-write)`" if you already have a GitHub account. Otherwise use "`HTTPS (read-only, anonymous)`"

Once the setting of the variables is completed click btn:[Next].
This leads to the [wizard]_Confirmation_ dialog.
This last step can be completed by clicking on btn:[Finish].

The Oomph installer first makes sure that all necessary Scout components and M2E connectors are available.
In case one or more components are missing, Oomph will first download and install them.
This triggers a restart request as shown in <<img-oomph_restart>>.

To complete the installation click btn:[Finish].
If your IDE needs to be restarted, select the same workspace in the [wizard]_Eclipse Launcher_ dialog.

After the restart Oomph will continue to download and install the Scout demo application showing the progress in the Eclipse importer dialog.
Once the download and installation has completed you may close the dialog with clicking the btn:[Finish] button.

===== Setup result

After the Setup of the "Scout Demo App", a lot of projects are materialized in the workspace (see the screenshot in <<img-oomph_workingsets>>).
The projects are organized in three working sets:

Demo App: Contacts:: The projects corresponding to the Scout Demo Application "Contacts".
Demo App: Widgets:: The projects corresponding to the Scout Demo Application "Widgets".
Demo Docs:: The scout documentation and the project containing most of the code snippets included in the documentation.

If you do not see the workingsets, you might need to select "menu:Top Level Elements[Working Sets]" from the Menu as displayed in <<img-workingsets_top_level>>

[[img-workingsets_top_level]]
.Select "Working Sets" as "Top Level Elements" in the "Package Explorer".

==== Run the Contacts Demo Application

With the Scout demo installed in our workspace we are now ready to start the application from within our IDE.

===== Start the application in the IDE

In the [wizard]_Package Explorer_ view of the IDE open the Maven module `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.all.app.dev`.
To run the Contacts application use the [menu]_Run As_ context menu on file `contacts-all-dev.launch` as shown in <<img-oomph_run_contacts_all>>.

[[img-oomph_run_contacts_all]]
.Start the Contacts application.

Once the startup sequence of the Contacts application has completed the console view in your Eclipse IDE should look like <<img-oomph_contacts_console>>.

===== Use the Contacts Demo in a Browser

With the Contacts demo running in the IDE open the application in your favorite browser via URL http://localhost:8082/.
To get the screen shown in <<img-contacts_persons_alice>> first click on the [folder]_Persons_ node and then double click on the ''Alice'' row.

==== What's Next?

Play with the Contacts application.
This provides a good overview of a typical Scout application.
You can browse through the data, open different forms and add/change entities.

Also have a quick look at the code.
The list on the left side of the application containing the nodes [folder]_Persons_ and [folder]_Organizations_ is implemented in class [java]+ContactOutline+ as shown in <<lst-contacts_outline>>.

.ContactOutline implementation.
----
include::{codedir}/contacts/org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/contacts/client/contact/ContactOutline.java[tags=Outline]
----

If you have clicked on the [folder]_Persons_ node a page with all available persons is shown.
This page is implemented in class [java]+PersonTablePage+ and the dialog to show/edit persons is implemented in class [java]+PersonForm+.

This is the end of the <<tutorial.html#tutorial, getting started>> guide.
