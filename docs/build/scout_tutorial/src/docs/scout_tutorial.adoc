[[sec-contacts_tutorial_overview]]
== A One Day Tutorial

In this tutorial we will create a "`Contacts`" Scout application.
The goal of this tutorial is to learn about the most prominent features of the Eclipse Scout framework.

Within a single day you will not only have learned more about Scout but also implemented a complete Scout application from the user interface to the data stored in a relational database.

For this tutorial we assume that you have successfully <<scout_install.adoc#scout_install, installed Eclipse Scout>> and gone through the <<scout_helloworld.adoc#scout_helloworld, "`Hello World`" tutorial>>.

== Tutorial Overview

According to this step-by-step tutorial, we will build a classical client server Scout application that includes a relational database to persist the entered data.

This application shows how to implement the most frequently used user interface components such as forms, tables, trees, menus and keyboard control.
On the server side, we show how to work with services, databases and how to use logging in Scout applications.

This tutorial is organized as follows.
In the <<sec-contacts_guide, first section>>, the finished demo application is explained from the user perspective.
The remaining sections focus on the individual steps to implement the "`Contacts`" application as listed below.

* Create <<sec-tutorial_new_project, a new Scout project>>
* Add <<sec-tutorial_database, database support>> for Apache Derby
* Add components to <<sec-tutorial_persons, manage persons>>
* Add Components to <<sec-tutorial_organizations, manage organizations>>
* <<sec-tutorial_module, Add a module>> to manage events
//** Add the module infrastructure
//** bla
* <<sec-tutorial_extensions, Add extensions>> to the core application
//** Outline
//** Person Form
//** Person Page

[[sec-contacts_guide]]
== The "`Contacts`" Application

The "`Contacts`" application is a client server application to manage personal contacts, organizations and events.
The persistence of entered data is achieved via simple JDBC access to a Derby database.

Figure <<img-app_contacts_personpage>> shows the "`Contacts`" application after connecting to the Scout UI application.
Clicking on a row in the person page activates the [menu]_Edit_ menu which is also available as a context menu on the table row.
The selected person can then be opened in a form to view and edit its data as shown in <<img-app_contacts_personform>>.

To run the "`Contacts`" application without implementing it first, you may take advantage of the fact that the code of the application is hosted on
link:https://github.com/bsi-software/org.eclipse.scout.docs/tree/{git-branch}/code/contacts[Github]
and start from there.
Alternatively, you can pull a Docker image of the "`Contacts`" application from https://hub.docker.com/r/eclipsescout/org.eclipse.scout.contacts/[Docker Hub].

[[sec-tutorial_new_project]]
== Create a new Scout Project
The first step of this tutorial is to create the initial "`Contacts`" application.
As in the <<scout_helloworld.adoc#,"`Hello World`" tutorial>> we start the Eclipse IDE with an empty workspace.
//  [7.0] jbr: move wizard desc into module, add scout tooling chapter and refactor eclipse_help
In the <<New Scout Project>> wizard enter the values shown below into the wizard fields.

Group Id:: `org.eclipse.scout.contacts`
Artifact Id:: `contacts`
Display Name:: _"Contacts Application"_

To start the wizard click the btn:[Next] button.

=== Tailoring of the Initial Project

For the purpose of the Contacts application, the created project needs to be slightly altered.
The items below list the necessary changes as of Neon milestone M5.
// TODO [7.0] jbr: verify/adapt from milestone to milestone
Therefore, the content of this section will have to be updated for the final release of the Scout Neon package in June 2016.

* contact.client classes/packages edits/renames
** rename WorkOutline to ContactOutline
** change label in ContactOutline.getConfiguredTitle from "Work" to "Contacts"
** change icon in ContactOutline.getConfiguredIconId from Icons.Pencil to AbstractIcons.Category
** rename package org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client.work to package org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client.contact
** ContactOutline.execCreateChildPages remove/comment out `pageList.add(new HelloWorldPage())`
** method Desktop.getConfiguredOutlines change `arrayList(WorkOutline.class, SearchOutline.class, SettingsOutline.class)` to `arrayList(ContactOutline.class)`
** class Desktop.WorkOutlineViewButton to Desktop.ContactOutlineViewButton
* contact.client removals: classes
** Desktop.BookmarkMenu
** Desktop.SearchOutlineViewButton
** Desktop.SettingsOutlineViewButton
* contact.shared server: packages
** {main|test}*.helloworld
* contact.client removals: packages
** {main|test}*.helloworld
** *.search

// TODO [7.0] jbr: add metadata for this listing in proper format

[[sec-tutorial_database]]
== Add JDBC support for Apache Derby
In this we add Apache Derby and the necessary JDBC support to our Scout project.
With this infrastructure in place we will be ready to read existing data from a database and persist changes back to the database.

For this we first have to add the <<sec-tutorial.jdbc.maven>>.
Then we can add the <<sec-tutorial.jdbc.components>> to access a Derby database in the demo application itself.

[[sec-tutorial.jdbc.maven]]
=== The Maven Dependencies

[[lst-tutorial.derby.version]]
[source,xml]
.Adding the Derby version property to the parent [file]_pom.xml_ file.
